<title>Work Experience</title>
<h1>Northrop Grumman</h1>
<p>I've spent my last two co-op sessions (Fall 2017 and Spring 2018) with the Xetron Campus of Northrop Grumman. During that
time I worked on the same project. I gained skills in Python and MySql, as well as experience with Docker. I also had experience creating
and maintaining a website. My leadership and teamwork skills also improved during this time so that I was able to help new members of the
team to learn the system and answer any questions they had.
