    gained technicial knowledge and confidence under the guidance of my co-workers. I enjoy working in cyber security and want to continue 
    to increase my knowledge of the field. I want to further develop my techinical skills and become more proficient in Ruby, C++, and other
  coding languages. I also want to challenge myself, and am always looking for new projects and opportunities that I can use to 
  achieve this goal.</p>
